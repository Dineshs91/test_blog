<h2>Guide to contributions</h2>

Contributions can range from writing test cases to improving code readability.
We emphasize on code readability. Any change which reduces readability will most probably turned down.
Please make sure all the tests are passing before making a pull request.

$ python manage.py test

Pull request will be accepted, only if tests are also written for any feature added.

Any additional test cases are also welcome.

<h2>Database settings</h2>
After doing any development and before you commit, remove the database settings from settings.py.
You don't want your db username and password in git history. 

It is cumbersome to add and remove settings everytime you commit. So we wrote a shell script to automate this process.
db_settings.sh. Copy this script into /virtualenv/bin. Put your database settings in it. 
To add db settings to settings.py, go to the directory where settings.py file is and run

    $ db_settings.sh settings.py add
    $ db_settings.sh settings.py del
 
add - For adding settings and del - For removing settings.

<h2>Search</h2>

Search has been implemented using Haystack and Solr. You have to install Solr separately.
http://archive.apache.org/dist/lucene/solr/3.6.2/apache-solr-3.6.2.tgz

Please check haystack’s website for all the configuration and setup stuff. Schema.xml
generation should be done.
